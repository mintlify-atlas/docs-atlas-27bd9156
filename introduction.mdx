## What is Executor?

Executor enables AI agents to execute code safely and efficiently with built-in approval gates, workspace-scoped policies, and comprehensive tool management. It bridges the gap between AI capabilities and secure code execution.

## Core Components

### Task Execution Engine

Executor runs TypeScript code in a secure Cloudflare Worker sandbox with full tool access. Tasks can invoke tools, request approvals, and stream output in real-time.

```typescript
// Example: Execute code via MCP
const result = await execute({
  code: `
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
  `,
  workspace: 'my-workspace'
});
```

### Approval System

Tool policies control execution flow:
- **Auto-allow**: Execute immediately without approval
- **Require approval**: Pause execution until approved by workspace admin
- **Deny**: Block execution of sensitive operations

### MCP Integration

Executor provides MCP endpoints for agent integration:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Authenticated MCP
# OAuth-protected endpoint
https://your-deployment.convex.site/mcp
```

```bash Anonymous MCP
# API key authentication
https://your-deployment.convex.site/mcp/anonymous?workspaceId=<id>
```
</CodeGroup>

## Deployment Options

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Binary Install (Recommended)">
    One-command installation with managed runtime:
    
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://executor.sh/install | bash
    ```
    
    Includes:
    - Self-contained binary with no global dependencies
    - Managed Convex local backend
    - Packaged web UI
    - Background service management
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="From Source">
    Build and run from the monorepo:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor
    cd executor
    bun install
    cp .env.example .env
    # Configure CONVEX_URL and CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT
    bun run dev
    ```
    
    Ideal for:
    - Development and contributions
    - Custom modifications
    - Integration with existing Convex deployments
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Cloud (SaaS)">
    Use the hosted version at executor.sh:
    
    - No installation required
    - Automatic updates
    - Managed infrastructure
    - WorkOS authentication
    - Stripe billing integration
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Architecture Overview

### Control Plane (Convex)

Convex functions manage:
- **Tasks**: Queued, running, and completed execution records
- **Approvals**: Pending approval requests and audit logs
- **Policies**: Workspace-scoped tool access rules
- **Credentials**: Encrypted secrets for tool authentication
- **Organizations**: Multi-tenant workspace hierarchy

### Execution Runtime

Two runtime adapters:
- **Cloudflare Worker**: Production sandbox (default for hosted deployments)
- **Local Bun**: Development runtime (requires `DANGEROUSLY_ALLOW_LOCAL_VM=1`)

### Web Application

Next.js dashboard for:
- Task monitoring and logs
- Approval management
- Tool source configuration
- Workspace settings
- Member management
- Billing (when Stripe is configured)

<Note>
  The web UI runs on port **5312** by default for binary installs and **4312** for source development.
</Note>

## Use Cases

### AI Agent Execution

Enable AI agents like Claude Code to execute arbitrary TypeScript with safety controls:

```bash
executor claude -- "analyze the codebase and fix type errors"
```

### CI/CD Integration

Run tasks as part of continuous integration pipelines with approval gates for deployments.

### API Workflow Automation

Combine multiple API calls with business logic in a single executable task:

```typescript
// Fetch from multiple sources and aggregate
const users = await fetch('/api/users');
const orders = await fetch('/api/orders');
return aggregateData(users, orders);
```

### Self-Service Tooling

Provide non-technical team members with safe access to data operations via approval workflows.

## Security Model

<Warning>
  Executor executes untrusted code. Always review approval requests carefully and configure tool policies appropriately.
</Warning>

### Sandbox Isolation

Code runs in isolated Cloudflare Worker environments with:
- No filesystem access
- No network access except via approved tools
- Limited CPU and memory
- Automatic timeout enforcement

### Authentication & Authorization

- **WorkOS**: Enterprise SSO for hosted deployments
- **Anonymous sessions**: Temporary workspaces for local/development use
- **API keys**: Scoped credentials for MCP clients
- **RBAC**: Workspace admins and members with distinct permissions

### Credential Management

Two storage backends:
- **Managed**: Encrypted storage in Convex
- **WorkOS Vault**: External encrypted credential storage
