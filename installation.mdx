description: Install Executor via binary, from source, or use the hosted version
---

# Installation

Executor supports three installation methods: binary install (recommended for local use), building from source (for development), and hosted SaaS (for production).

## Binary Install (Recommended)

The binary installer provides a self-contained Executor runtime with no global dependencies required.

### One-Command Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://executor.sh/install | bash
```

This installs:
- `executor` CLI binary at `~/.executor/bin/executor`
- Managed Convex local backend
- Packaged web UI
- Node runtime for web server
- Background service management

<Note>
  The installer automatically adds `~/.executor/bin` to your shell PATH. Restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc` (or `~/.zshrc`) to use the `executor` command.
</Note>

### What Gets Installed

### Install Options

<CodeGroup>
```bash Specific Version
curl -fsSL https://executor.sh/install | bash -s -- --version v1.2.3
```

```bash Skip PATH Modification
curl -fsSL https://executor.sh/install | bash -s -- --no-modify-path
```

```bash Local Binary
# Build first
bun run --cwd executor build:binary

# Install from local binary
bash executor/install --binary executor/dist/executor
```

```bash Custom Install Directory
export EXECUTOR_INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/bin"
curl -fsSL https://executor.sh/install | bash
```
</CodeGroup>

### Verify Installation

Check that Executor is installed and services are healthy:

```bash
executor doctor
```

Expected output:
```text
Executor status: ready
Dashboard: http://127.0.0.1:5312 (running)
Backend: running (http://127.0.0.1:5410)
Functions: available
MCP endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:5411/v1/mcp
```

<Tip>
  Use `executor doctor --verbose` to see detailed runtime information including paths, versions, and configuration.
</Tip>

### Post-Install

The installer automatically:
1. Stops any existing Executor services
2. Installs/updates the binary and runtime
3. Starts the backend and web UI in the background
4. Waits for services to become healthy

Access the dashboard at **http://localhost:5312**

## From Source

Build and run Executor from the monorepo for development or to integrate with an existing Convex deployment.

### Prerequisites

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Bun">
    Executor uses Bun as its runtime and package manager:
    
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Convex Account">
    Create a Convex account and project at [convex.dev](https://www.convex.dev).
    
    You'll need:
    - Deployment URL (e.g., `https://happy-animal-123.convex.cloud`)
    - Deployment name (e.g., `happy-animal-123`)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Clone and Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor.git
cd executor

# Install dependencies
bun install
```

### Configure Environment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Copy environment template">
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set required variables">
    Edit `.env` and set at minimum:
    
    ```bash .env
    CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=happy-animal-123
    CONVEX_URL=https://happy-animal-123.convex.cloud
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Optional: Configure services">
    For full functionality, also configure:
    
    ```bash .env
    # Storage (required for file operations in cloud deployments)
    AGENT_STORAGE_PROVIDER=agentfs-cloudflare
    CLOUDFLARE_SANDBOX_RUN_URL=https://your-worker.workers.dev
    CLOUDFLARE_SANDBOX_AUTH_TOKEN=your-token
    
    # Authentication (for WorkOS-based auth)
    WORKOS_CLIENT_ID=client_...
    WORKOS_API_KEY=sk_...
    WORKOS_COOKIE_PASSWORD=complex-secret-at-least-32-chars
    
    # Billing (for Stripe integration)
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
    STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
    STRIPE_PRICE_ID=price_...
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Run Development Services

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Full Stack (Recommended)">
    Start all services with a single command:
    
    ```bash
    bun run dev
    ```
    
    This starts:
    - Convex dev watcher (functions hot reload)
    - Web UI at `http://localhost:4312`
    - MCP endpoints at `<CONVEX_SITE_URL>/mcp`
    - Assistant server (if configured)
    - Discord bot (if `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` is set)
    
    PIDs are tracked in `.dev.pids`. Stop all with:
    ```bash
    bun run kill:all
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Executor Only">
    Run just the Executor components (separate terminals):
    
    ```bash Terminal 1: Convex
    bun run dev:executor:convex
    ```
    
    ```bash Terminal 2: Web UI
    bun run dev:executor:web
    ```
    
    Web UI runs at `http://localhost:4312`
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Manual Services">
    Run services individually:
    
    ```bash Convex Dev
    cd executor/packages/convex
    bunx convex dev
    ```
    
    ```bash Web App
    cd executor/apps/web
    bun run dev
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Local Runtime vs Cloud

<Note>
  When running from source, you can use either a local Bun runtime or Cloudflare Workers.
</Note>

**Local Bun Runtime** (development only):
```bash .env
DANGEROUSLY_ALLOW_LOCAL_VM=1
AGENT_STORAGE_PROVIDER=agentfs-local
```

**Cloudflare Workers** (production-ready):
```bash .env
# DANGEROUSLY_ALLOW_LOCAL_VM not set
AGENT_STORAGE_PROVIDER=agentfs-cloudflare
CLOUDFLARE_SANDBOX_RUN_URL=https://your-worker.workers.dev
CLOUDFLARE_SANDBOX_AUTH_TOKEN=your-token
```

### Build Binary from Source

Compile a native binary for distribution:

```bash
cd executor
bun run build:binary
```

Output:
- Binary: `executor/dist/executor`
- Runtime bundle: `executor/dist/release/executor-runtime-{os}-{arch}.tar.gz`

Install locally:
```bash
bash executor/install --binary executor/dist/executor --no-modify-path
```

## Hosted SaaS

Use Executor without any installation at **executor.sh**.

## Upgrade

Upgrade an existing binary installation:

```bash
executor upgrade
```

This:
1. Downloads the latest installer
2. Stops running services
3. Upgrades binary and runtime
4. Restarts services
5. Preserves local data

<Tip>
  Use `executor upgrade --version v1.2.3` to install a specific version.
</Tip>

## Uninstall

Remove Executor and all runtime files:

```bash
executor uninstall --yes
```

This removes:
- `~/.executor/bin/executor`
- `~/.executor/runtime/` (including local data)
- Background services

<Warning>
  Uninstall does **not** remove the PATH entry from your shell rc file. Remove it manually:
  
  ```bash
  # Remove this line from ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
  export PATH=$HOME/.executor/bin:$PATH
  ```
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

### Services Not Starting

**Check status**:
```bash
executor doctor --verbose
```

**View logs**:
```bash
tail -f ~/.executor/runtime/logs/backend.log
tail -f ~/.executor/runtime/logs/web.log
```

**Restart services**:
```bash
executor down
executor up
executor web &
```

### Port Conflicts

Change default ports if they're already in use:

```bash
export EXECUTOR_BACKEND_PORT=6410
export EXECUTOR_BACKEND_SITE_PORT=6411
export EXECUTOR_WEB_PORT=6312
executor down
executor up
```

### Binary Not Found

If `executor` command is not found after install:

```bash
# Manually add to PATH (bash)
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/.executor/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Or use full path
~/.executor/bin/executor doctor
```

### Functions Not Available

If `executor doctor` shows "Functions: unavailable":

1. **Check backend logs**:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.executor/runtime/logs/backend.log
   ```

2. **Verify backend is running**:
   ```bash
   curl http://127.0.0.1:5410/version
   ```

3. **Restart and watch logs**:
   ```bash
   executor down
   executor up  # runs in foreground
   ```

### Permission Denied

If you get permission errors:

```bash
# Fix binary permissions
chmod +x ~/.executor/bin/executor

# Fix runtime directory permissions
chmod -R u+rw ~/.executor/runtime
```
