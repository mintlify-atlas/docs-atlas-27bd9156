description: Deploy Executor locally with the binary CLI and managed runtime
---

Executor provides a fully self-contained binary installation that manages its own runtime, including a local Convex backend, Node.js runtime, and packaged web UI. No global dependencies required.

## Quick Install

Install Executor with a single command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://executor.sh/install | bash
```

The installer will:
- Download the executor binary to `~/.executor/bin/`
- Install the managed runtime to `~/.executor/runtime/`
- Start background services automatically
- Add executor to your PATH

## Managed Runtime

The binary manages a complete runtime environment under `~/.executor/runtime/`:

- **Convex Local Backend**: Managed `convex-local-backend` binary
- **Node.js Runtime**: Bundled Node.js v22.22.0 for the web UI
- **Web UI**: Packaged Next.js production build
- **Local Data**: SQLite database and file storage
- **Configuration**: Instance credentials and port settings

<Note>
  The managed runtime provides local-first operation without requiring cloud dependencies or internet connectivity during execution.
</Note>

## Binary CLI Commands

After installation, use these commands to manage your Executor instance:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Status">
    Run a health check to verify all services are running:
    
    ```bash
    executor doctor
    ```
    
    For detailed diagnostics:
    
    ```bash
    executor doctor --verbose
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Services">
    Start the managed backend manually:
    
    ```bash
    executor up
    ```
    
    Start the web UI:
    
    ```bash
    executor web
    ```
    
    Both services start automatically during installation.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Stop Services">
    Stop all background services:
    
    ```bash
    executor down
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access Backend Directly">
    Pass arguments to the managed backend:
    
    ```bash
    executor backend --help
    executor backend --version
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Default Ports

The managed runtime uses these local ports:

| Service | Port | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Backend API | 5410 | Convex backend HTTP endpoint |
| Backend Site | 5411 | Site proxy for MCP and HTTP routes |
| Web UI | 5312 | Next.js dashboard |

<Note>
  Override default ports by setting `EXECUTOR_BACKEND_PORT`, `EXECUTOR_BACKEND_SITE_PORT`, or `EXECUTOR_WEB_PORT` environment variables before running the installer.
</Note>

## Data Storage

All runtime data is stored in `~/.executor/runtime/convex-data/`:

- `convex_local_backend.sqlite3` - Main database
- `storage/` - File storage for tasks and artifacts

This directory persists across upgrades. To reset your local instance:

```bash
executor down
rm -rf ~/.executor/runtime/convex-data
executor up
```

## MCP Endpoint

The self-hosted instance exposes MCP endpoints at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5411/v1/mcp/anonymous
```

Authenticate using the API key from your workspace settings in the web UI.

## Integration with Claude Code

Executor includes built-in Claude Code integration:

```bash
executor claude
```

This command:
1. Generates a temporary MCP configuration
2. Bootstraps an anonymous workspace session
3. Launches Claude Code with the `mcp__executor__execute` tool

<CodeGroup>
```bash Basic Usage
executor claude
```

```bash With Prompt
executor claude -- "fix failing tests"
```

```bash Keep Bash Tool
executor claude --allow-bash -- --model sonnet
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  Claude Code CLI must be installed first: `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash`
</Note>

## Upgrade

Update to the latest release:

```bash
executor upgrade
```

Install a specific version:

```bash
executor upgrade --version v0.1.5
```

## Uninstall

Remove the executor binary and managed runtime:

```bash
executor uninstall --yes
```

Manually remove the PATH entry from your shell rc file if needed:

```bash
# Remove this line from ~/.zshrc, ~/.bashrc, or ~/.profile
export PATH=$HOME/.executor/bin:$PATH
```

## Advanced: Custom Installation Paths

Customize installation directories with environment variables:

```bash
# Custom binary location
export EXECUTOR_INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/bin"

# Custom runtime location
export EXECUTOR_RUNTIME_DIR="$HOME/.local/share/executor"

curl -fsSL https://executor.sh/install | bash
```

## Advanced: Local Development Build

Install from a local source build:

```bash
# From the executor/ directory
bun run build:binary
bash install --binary dist/executor
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Services won't start">
    Check logs for errors:
    
    ```bash
    cat ~/.executor/runtime/logs/backend.log
    cat ~/.executor/runtime/logs/web.log
    ```
    
    Verify ports are not in use:
    
    ```bash
    lsof -ti tcp:5410
    lsof -ti tcp:5312
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Web UI shows connection error">
    Ensure the backend is running:
    
    ```bash
    curl http://127.0.0.1:5410/version
    ```
    
    If not running:
    
    ```bash
    executor down
    executor up
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Doctor command fails">
    Run with verbose output:
    
    ```bash
    executor doctor --verbose
    ```
    
    Skip function checks if only testing runtime:
    
    ```bash
    executor doctor --runtime-only
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Upgrade fails">
    Manually stop services first:
    
    ```bash
    executor down
    executor upgrade
    ```
  </Accordion>
