description: Execute your first task with Executor in 5 minutes
---

# Quick Start

This guide walks you through installing Executor and running your first task execution.

## Prerequisites

<Check>
  You'll need a terminal with `curl` and `bash` available. Works on Linux and macOS.
</Check>

## Step 1: Install Executor

Install the Executor binary with one command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://executor.sh/install | bash
```

The installer will:
1. Download the executor binary for your platform
2. Install the managed runtime (Convex backend + web UI)
3. Start services in the background
4. Add executor to your PATH

<Note>
  The install takes 30-60 seconds. Grab some coffee while it sets up!
</Note>

### Verify Installation

Restart your terminal or source your shell rc:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc for zsh users
```

Check that Executor is healthy:

```bash
executor doctor
```

You should see:
```
Executor status: ready
Dashboard: http://127.0.0.1:5312 (running)
Backend: running (http://127.0.0.1:5410)
Functions: available
MCP endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:5411/v1/mcp
```

<Warning>
  If services aren't running, try `executor up` to start the backend manually.
</Warning>

## Step 2: Open the Dashboard

Open the web UI in your browser:

```bash
open http://localhost:5312
```

Or navigate to **http://localhost:5312** manually.

The dashboard shows:
- **Tasks**: Recent and running task executions
- **Approvals**: Pending approval requests
- **Tools**: Configured tool sources and available tools
- **Settings**: Workspace configuration

<Tip>
  On first launch, Executor creates an anonymous workspace. This workspace is tied to your local installation and persists across restarts.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Execute Your First Task

Let's run a simple task using Claude Code (or any MCP client).

### Option A: Using Claude Code

If you have [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/download) installed:

```bash
executor claude -- "write a simple hello world script"
```

This command:
1. Bootstraps an anonymous MCP session
2. Generates temporary API credentials
3. Starts Claude Code with Executor's MCP endpoint pre-configured
4. Disables Claude's native Bash tool (use `--allow-bash` to keep it)

<Accordion title="What does 'executor claude' do?">
  The `executor claude` command is a convenience wrapper that:
  
  1. Checks if Claude Code CLI is installed
  2. Ensures the managed backend is running
  3. Creates an anonymous workspace session (or reuses existing)
  4. Generates an MCP API key
  5. Writes a temporary MCP config at `/tmp/executor-claude-*/mcp.json`
  6. Launches Claude Code with:
     - `--mcp-config` pointing to the temp config
     - `--strict-mcp-config` to prevent config conflicts
     - `--append-system-prompt` with Executor-specific guidance
     - `--disallowedTools Bash` (unless `--allow-bash` is passed)
  
  The temporary config looks like:
  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "executor": {
        "type": "http",
        "url": "http://127.0.0.1:5411/v1/mcp/anonymous?workspaceId=...",
        "headers": {
          "x-api-key": "ek_..."
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
</Accordion>

Claude will use Executor's `execute` tool to run code:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Claude's execution
// Claude sends this to executor via MCP
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting);
return { message: greeting };
```

```bash Output
Hello, World!
```
</CodeGroup>

### Option B: Manual MCP Configuration

For other MCP clients, configure manually:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get your MCP credentials">
    Run this to bootstrap an anonymous session and get credentials:
    
    ```bash
    executor doctor --verbose
    ```
    
    Note the **MCP endpoint** URL.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure your MCP client">
    Add Executor as an MCP server in your client's config:
    
    ```json mcp.json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "executor": {
          "type": "http",
          "url": "http://127.0.0.1:5411/v1/mcp/anonymous?workspaceId=<your-workspace-id>",
          "headers": {
            "x-api-key": "<your-api-key>"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use the execute tool">
    Call the `execute` tool from your agent:
    
    ```typescript
    // Tool call parameters
    {
      "code": "return 'Hello from Executor!';",
      "description": "Test execution"
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Option C: API Direct Call

You can also call the MCP endpoint directly via HTTP:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5411/v1/mcp/anonymous?workspaceId=<workspace-id> \
  -H "x-api-key: <your-api-key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "execute",
      "arguments": {
        "code": "console.log('Hello!'); return { success: true };",
        "description": "Test task"
      }
    },
    "id": 1
  }'
```

## Step 4: View Task in Dashboard

Switch to your browser and refresh the dashboard.

You should see your task execution:
- **Status**: Completed (green) or Running (blue)
- **Code**: The TypeScript that was executed
- **Output**: Console logs and return value
- **Duration**: How long the task took

</Frame>

## Step 5: Try Tool Invocation

Now let's execute code that calls external tools.

### Add a Tool Source

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Tools page">
    Click **Tools** in the dashboard sidebar
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add a tool source">
    Click **Add Tool Source** and enter:
    - **Type**: `openapi`
    - **URL**: `https://api.github.com/openapi.json`
    - **Name**: `github-api`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save and sync">
    Click **Save**. Executor will fetch and parse the OpenAPI spec, creating tools for each endpoint.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Tool discovery happens asynchronously. Refresh the page after a few seconds to see discovered tools.
</Note>

### Execute Code Using Tools

Now use Claude Code to call GitHub API:

```bash
executor claude -- "use the github api to fetch my user profile"
```

Claude will:
1. Discover the `github__get_user` tool (auto-generated from OpenAPI)
2. Execute code that invokes the tool:

```typescript
// Claude generates something like:
const profile = await tools.github__get_user({
  username: 'your-username'
});

return profile;
```

3. Executor runs the code, intercepts the tool call, and executes it
4. Returns the API response to your code

## Step 6: Set Up Approval Workflows

For sensitive operations, you can require manual approval.

### Create an Approval Policy

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Tools">
    Open the Tools page in the dashboard
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Find a tool">
    Locate a sensitive tool (e.g., `github__delete_repo`)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set policy">
    Click the tool and set policy to **Require Approval**
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Trigger an Approval

Run code that uses the restricted tool:

```bash
executor claude -- "delete the test repository"
```

The task will:
1. Start executing
2. Pause when it reaches the `github__delete_repo` tool call
3. Create an approval request

### Review and Approve

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Approvals page">
    Click **Approvals** in the dashboard
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review the request">
    See:
    - What tool is being called
    - What arguments are being passed
    - The full task code and context
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Approve or Deny">
    Click **Approve** to allow execution, or **Deny** to cancel
  </Step>
</Steps>

The task resumes immediately after approval and completes.

<Tip>
  Set tools to **Deny** to completely block them, or **Auto-allow** to skip approval gates.
</Tip>

## Common Tasks

### Stop Services

Stop the background backend and web UI:

```bash
executor down
```

### Restart Services

Restart if services crashed or you changed config:

```bash
executor down
executor up &
executor web &
```

### View Logs

Tail service logs:

```bash
# Backend logs
tail -f ~/.executor/runtime/logs/backend.log

# Web UI logs
tail -f ~/.executor/runtime/logs/web.log
```

### Upgrade Executor

Update to the latest version:

```bash
executor upgrade
```

### Check Health

Run diagnostics:

```bash
executor doctor --verbose
```

## Troubleshooting

### Claude Command Not Found

If `executor claude` says Claude is not installed:

```bash
# Install Claude Code CLI
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

### Services Not Running

If `executor doctor` shows services aren't running:

```bash
# Start backend
executor up

# Start web in another terminal
executor web
```

### Port Already in Use

Change ports if defaults conflict:

```bash
export EXECUTOR_BACKEND_PORT=6410
export EXECUTOR_WEB_PORT=6312
executor down
executor up
```

### Task Execution Failed

Check the task detail in the dashboard for:
- **Error messages** in output
- **Tool call failures** (auth errors, rate limits)
- **Timeout issues** (increase with `timeoutMs` parameter)

### Can't Access Dashboard

If web UI doesn't load:

1. **Check web service is running**:
   ```bash
   curl http://127.0.0.1:5312
   ```

2. **Check logs**:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.executor/runtime/logs/web.log
   ```

3. **Restart web UI**:
   ```bash
   executor web
   ```

## Tips and Tricks

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use --allow-bash for system commands">
    Keep Claude's Bash tool enabled while using Executor:
    
    ```bash
    executor claude --allow-bash -- "list files and analyze them"
    ```
    
    Claude can now use both Bash and Executor's execute tool.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Pass arguments to Claude">
    Pass any Claude Code flags after `--`:
    
    ```bash
    executor claude -- --model sonnet "write a parser"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Run backend in foreground for debugging">
    See real-time backend logs:
    
    ```bash
    executor up  # runs in foreground, Ctrl+C to stop
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Preserve data across reinstalls">
    Your workspace data lives in `~/.executor/runtime/convex-data/`.
    
    Back it up before uninstalling:
    ```bash
    cp -r ~/.executor/runtime/convex-data ~/executor-backup
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use multiple workspaces">
    The binary install creates one anonymous workspace by default.
    
    For multiple workspaces, use the hosted version at executor.sh or run from source with multiple Convex deployments.
  </Accordion>
